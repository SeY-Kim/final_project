5. Current Time/Date.

If I get more ideas, more data will be uploaded, and all data are Real time based, which will be updated every 10 seconds. 
 
In this project, raspberrypi will be used, so all devices in same local internet connection can access to the webservice. User can simply access the web service through web browser.
